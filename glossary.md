## Glossary

- Bag-of-words #nlp

- Ontology #data_model
  - is a semantic data model that define the types of things that exist in our domain and the properties that can be used to describe them.
  - Ontologies are generalized data models, meaning that they only model general types of things that share certain properties, but donâ€™t include information about specific individuals in our domain. For example, instead of describing your dog, Spot, and all of his individual characteristics, an ontology should focus on the general concept of dogs, trying to capture characteristics that most/many dogs might have.
  - Three main components:
    - Classes: the distinct types of things that exist in our data.
    - Relationships: properties that connect two classes.
    - Attributes: properties that describe an individual class.
