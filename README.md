you name it.

Contribution and fork is welcome.
Kindly refer to our Code Of Conduct [here](code_of_conduct.md) before contributing.

Stay streamlined.

## General Contributions

If you see that the glossary is missing a term, we would love your help in adding it!

### How to Contribute Terms

1. We use markdown format because we are too lazy.
2. We start from overview-like format, all terms or assets in one markdown file, [glossary.md], first.
3. Every term or asset is a bullet item, followed by one-linear description and some futher sub- bullet points for supplementary info.

### Example

```markdown
- Bag-of-words
  - is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval. In this model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity.

1. Every contribution made should adhere to the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
2. Avoid usage of country specific language when adding a new term, in the term definition and for the examples provided.
3. [Use simple language](https://plainlanguage.gov/resources/articles/dash-writing-tips/). Avoid idioms and be clear.
